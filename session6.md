# **Session 6: Sensors and Motors in Depth**

---

## Goals

<!-- Notes: We will get a better understanding of how PROS and sensors work through using the vision sensor -->
* How to use the PROS API to program VEX sensors
* Understand VEX Vision Sensor
* Different ways of moving with motors

---

## Overview of the Vision Sensor

<!-- We can also use it together with autonomous mode to do more complex tasks -->
* This sensor allows for our robot to see objects and interact with them
* For example, locate green objects and move towards them

## Initializing our Vision Sensor to Detect Objects

* Define vision port
* Specify a colour range to detect for our vision sensor
* Colour range called colour signature

## Interacting with Objects


## Discussion


## Demo


## Motors

* Many ways to do movement with motors
* Some better for autonomous mode, some better for user mode

## Initializing our Motors


## Demo


## Motors for Autonomous Mode
