# Outline

* Begin by giving a background of the VEX Robotics competition, the rules and format of the competition, and the hardware we will be using such as the “VEX V5 Brain”.
* We introduce the idea of programming languages, give a brief history of C, discuss why C is still used and when it is useful. We will talk about the basics of performance, memory and runtime efficiency in C compared to other languages. Will give motivating examples of well known C projects such as the Linux kernel.
* Introduction to programming libraries, why they are useful, and why we will be using PROS. We can then briefly introduce IDEs, then setup and install VS Code with the PROS plugin.
* Homework and in class discussion for the first session will be basic general questions about programming languages, libraries, and robotics. For example, “Compare C and Python, and when you would like to use one vs the other”.
