## Session 1

### Session 1-1: Introduction to VEX Robotics

* Overview of the VEX Robotics competition, including its rules and format.
Discussion on the hardware components, specifically the "VEX V5 Brain".

### Session 1-2: Programming Languages and C

* Introduction to the concept of programming languages.
Brief history of C, its relevance in modern tech, and examples like the Linux kernel.
Comparisons between C and other languages, highlighting performance, memory, and runtime efficiency.

### Session 1-3: Libraries and PROS

* Explanation of programming libraries and their usefulness.
Introduction to PROS and its advantages.
Brief discussion on Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and setup instructions for VS Code with the PROS plugin.

### Homework & Discussion

* Questions on programming languages, libraries, and robotics.
Specific task: "Compare C and Python, and discuss scenarios for using each."## Session 2

* We are going to introduce the basic structure of a C program, and assume no programming background. Intro to the main function, indentation, basic I/O, and formatting of C code.
* How to use variables, purpose of different types such as int, char, float, and how to use arithmetic operators like +, -, *, / vs //, %, etc.
* Lastly, we will discuss how to compile and run a C program.
* There will be an in class demo with coding examples, and the homework will make use of the above concepts in C.

## Session 3

* Introduction to for loops, while loops, and how to use them in the context of a VEX program.
* How to use functions, and basics of problem solving through functions. We will look at examples of how functions are used in PROS, and what the benefits of using functions are.
* Will introduce core PROS functions such as opcontrol, autonomous, initialize, but detailed explanation will come later.

## Session 4

* Header files in programming define interfaces to a set of functions. They contain function declarations, macro definitions, and other necessary constructs.

* Analog vs Digital definition. Analog signals are continuous and can take any value within a range, often seen in natural systems. Digital signals, on the other hand, are discrete, representing specific values, commonly used in electronic systems and computing.

* PROS Project Structure Review: The PROS project structure organizes code and resources for VEX robotics development. It offers a systematic arrangement of files and directories, enhancing code manageability and accessibility.

* Initialize, Opcontrol, Autonomous Functions Intro: In PROS, the initialize function sets up the robot before any robot control begins. opcontrol dictates the robot's behavior during the driver control period, while autonomous defines the robot's actions when it's running by itself in competitions.
