# Outline

## Session 1

* Begin by giving a background of the VEX Robotics competition, the rules and format of the competition, and the hardware we will be using such as the “VEX V5 Brain”.
* We introduce the idea of programming languages, give a brief history of C, discuss why C is still used and when it is useful. We will talk about the basics of performance, memory and runtime efficiency in C compared to other languages. Will give motivating examples of well known C projects such as the Linux kernel.
* Introduction to programming libraries, why they are useful, and why we will be using PROS. We can then briefly introduce IDEs, then setup and install VS Code with the PROS plugin.
* Homework and in class discussion for the first session will be basic general questions about programming languages, libraries, and robotics. For example, “Compare C and Python, and when you would like to use one vs the other”.

## Session 2

* We are going to introduce the basic structure of a C program, and assume no programming background. Intro to the main function, indentation, basic I/O, and formatting of C code.
* How to use variables, purpose of different types such as int, char, float, and how to use arithmetic operators like +, -, *, / vs //, %, etc.
* Lastly, we will discuss how to compile and run a C program.
* There will be an in class demo with coding examples, and the homework will make use of the above concepts in C.

## Session 3

* Introduction to for loops, while loops, and how to use them in the context of a VEX program.
* How to use functions, and basics of problem solving through functions. We will look at examples of how functions are used in PROS, and what the benefits of using functions are.
* Will introduce core PROS functions such as opcontrol, autonomous, initialize, but detailed explanation will come later.

## Session 4

* Header files in programming define interfaces to a set of functions. They contain function declarations, macro definitions, and other necessary constructs.

* Analog vs Digital definition. Analog signals are continuous and can take any value within a range, often seen in natural systems. Digital signals, on the other hand, are discrete, representing specific values, commonly used in electronic systems and computing.

* PROS Project Structure Review: The PROS project structure organizes code and resources for VEX robotics development. It offers a systematic arrangement of files and directories, enhancing code manageability and accessibility.

* Initialize, Opcontrol, Autonomous Functions Intro: In PROS, the initialize function sets up the robot before any robot control begins. opcontrol dictates the robot's behavior during the driver control period, while autonomous defines the robot's actions when it's running by itself in competitions.
