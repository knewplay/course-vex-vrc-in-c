# Outline

## **Session 1: Introduction to VEX and Programming**

### Slides 1.1

* Title slide: "Introduction to VEX Robotics Competition"
* Overview of the VEX Robotics competition, including its rules, format, and what you will learn.
* Present key components and hardware such as the VEX V5 Brain.
* We can provide short video of past VEX competitions in action.

### Discussion 1-1

* What do you think the some of the features of the VEX V5 brain are? What kind of things can it allow our robot to do?

### Demo 1-1

* We will introduce the main hardware, the "VEX V5 Brain", and give physical demo of its use and features.

### Slides 1-2

* Title slide: Programming Languages and the Role of C

* Introduction to the concept of programming languages.
* Brief history of C and its relevance in modern technology. Provide examples of well known software written in C, such as the Linux kernel.
* Comparisons between C and other languages, highlighting basics of performance, memory, and runtime efficiency.

### Discussion 1-2

* Why do you think C is still relevant today?
* What type of software is C usually used for?

### Example Code

* "Hello World" program in C

### Demo 1-2

* Point out syntax, indentation, basic structure of C program.

### Slides 1-3

* Title Slide: Programming Libraries and PROS
* Explanation of programming libraries, i.e. libraries provide code written for us that we can use to build on top of without worrying about details.
* Introduction to PROS and its advantages over other libraries for VEX. For example, PROS is more popular and better supported than RobotC.

### Discussions

* What do you think the benefits of libraries are?
* How do libraries speed up the development process?
* How does PROS help us in programming our VEX Robot?

### Slides 1-4

* Title Slide: IDEs and Common Software Tools
* We will discuss popular IDEs and text editors such as VS Code, Sublime, Vim, Emacs.
* Basic intro to VS Code and how to navigate the UI.
* We will introduce git and github. Git is a version control software that allows us to conveniently take snapshots of our code at any point in time, and revert back to it.

### Discussion 1-4

* What are the benefits of VS Code?
* What are the benefits of git?

### Demo 1-4

* Installing and setting up the PROS Plugin in VS Code.

### Homework

1. Compare C and Python, and discuss scenarios for using each.
2. Write a hello world program in C using VS Code. Make sure it compiles and can print "Hello world".
