# Generate PDF or HTML Slides from Markdown

This project contains Markdown files that can be easily converted into a slide deck in PDF or HTML format using the [Marp](https://marp.app/) extension for VS Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Marp for VS Code](https://marp.app/) extension

## Steps to Generate HTML or PDF Slides

1. **Open the Markdown File**:
   Open the `.md` file in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open the Marp Panel**:
   With the Markdown file open, click on the 'Marp' icon in the top menu of the VS Code editor to open the Marp panel. This icon looks like a 'M'.

3. **Export as HTML or PDF**:
   In the Marp panel, you'll find an option to export your slides as a PDF. Click on the 'Export slide deck...' button. This will open a dialog box where you can choose the location to save your file in either HTML or PDF format.

4. **Save the file**:
   Choose your desired file location, enter a name for your PDF file, and click 'Save'. The Marp plugin will generate the PDF from your Markdown file and save it to the specified location.

5. **View Your Slides**
   Navigate to the location where you saved your file and open it to view your slide deck.
