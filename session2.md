## *Basic Structure of a C program*

* Explanation of the main function, and its significance in a C program. Most importantly, we will discuss how all program execution in C starts from main.
* Review how to properly indent, space, and format code properly for readability.
* Give basic explanation of header, i.e. what does #include <stdio.h> mean.

---

## Discussion

* Where does the code execution begin in a C program?
* Why do we need a main function?

---

## Demo

* Have students write setup for C program
* Some examples of incorrect C programs with common mistakes in syntax and formatting

---

## Variables in C: Types and Operators

* We will provide an introduction to important variable types in C, such as void, int, char, and float.
* How to declare variables, and how to update variables

---

## Discussion

* Imagine a robot is reading vision sensor data as input, and you want to store the data into a variable. How do you think the data is represented, and what should the type be of the variable?
* What are the different uses for int, char, and float variables?
* What is the difference between the /, //, and % operators?

---

## Demo

* C program showing different types of variable assignments and operators, as well as snippet of PROS opcontrol function that makes use of void and int variables.

---

## Compiling C Programs

* Basic introduction to the concept of compiling - i.e. transforming C code into executable format.
* Why compiling is necessary in C.

---

## Demo

* Live demonstration of compiling a C program, from writing the code to execution of the compiled output.

---

## Homework

* Within main(), write code that will compute area of a triangle by declaring variables, and using appropriate arithmetic operations. Try to experiment using float and int.
